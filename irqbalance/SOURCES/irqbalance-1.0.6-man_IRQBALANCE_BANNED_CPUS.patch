+Provides a mask of cpus which irqbalance should ignore and never assign interrupts to.
+This is a hex mask without the leading ’0x’, on systems with large numbers of processors
+each group of eight hex digits is separated by a comma ’,’. i.e. ‘export IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS=fc0‘
+would prevent irqbalance from assigning irqs to the 7th-12th cpus (cpu6-cpu11) or
+‘export IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS=ff000000,00000001‘ would prevent irqbalance from
+assigning irqs to the 1st (cpu0) and 57th-64th cpus (cpu56-cpu63).
