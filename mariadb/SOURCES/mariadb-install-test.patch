+For use in Red Hat distributions, you should run the script as user mysql,

+       # su -s /bin/bash mysql -c "./mysql-test-run --skip-test-list=rh-skipped-tests.list"

+This will use the installed mysql executables, but will run a private copy
+of the server process (using data files within /usr/share/mysql-test),
+so you need not start the mysqld service beforehand.
+
+The "--skip-test-list=rh-skipped-tests.list" option excludes tests that are
+known to fail on one or more Red-Hat-supported platforms.  You can omit it
+if you want to check whether such failures occur for you.  Documentation
+about the reasons for omitting such tests can be found in the file
+rh-skipped-tests.list.

+To clean up afterwards, remove the created "var" subdirectory, eg

 With no test cases named on the command line, mysql-test-run falls back
 to the normal "non-extern" behavior. The reason for this is that some
