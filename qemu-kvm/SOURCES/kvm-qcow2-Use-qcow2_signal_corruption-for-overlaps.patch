BZ: 1129893

Use the new function in case of a failed overlap check.

This changes output in case of corruption, so adapt iotest 060's
reference output accordingly.

Conflicts:
	block/qcow2-refcount.c

qcow2_pre_write_overlap_check() did not use qapi_event_send_*()
downstream, but that code is being removed anyway.
