BZ: 1004347

Using s->snapshots_size instead of snapshots_size for the metadata
overlap check in qcow2_write_snapshots leads to the detection of an
overlap with the main qcow2 image header when deleting the last
snapshot, since s->snapshots_size has not yet been updated and is
therefore non-zero. However, the offset returned by qcow2_alloc_clusters
will be zero since snapshots_size is zero. Therefore, an overlap is
detected albeit no such will occur.

This patch fixes this by replacing s->snapshots_size by snapshots_size
when calling qcow2_pre_write_overlap_check.
