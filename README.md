# sig-core-AltArch
Repository that will contain specific needed patches to build upstream packages on specific cpu arch

The real source (aka Source0) should come from either :
 * git.centos.org (aka upstream for most of the packages)
 * $upstream project (like kernel.org for vanilla/upstream kernel)
